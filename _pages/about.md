I'm a data scientist living and working in London.
This site is a place for me to occasionally ramble about stuff, probably related to statistics.

My background is in astrophysics -- I got my PhD from the [Institute of Astronomy](https://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/) in Cambridge in 2017.
These days, I enjoy applying statistical thinking to a variety of problems, like [fantasy football](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/research-engineering/programme-articles/airsenal).

I'm particularly interested in Bayesian methodologies, and probabilistic programming (usually in [Stan](https://mc-stan.org)).
