Now that the group stages are over, here are the probabilities that the remaining teams will win the world cup:

| Team         | Probability of winning the world cup |
|--------------|--------------------------------------|
| New Zealand  | 0.428                                |
| South Africa | 0.206                                |
| England      | 0.165                                |
| Wales        | 0.082                                |
| Ireland      | 0.057                                |
| Australia    | 0.038                                |
| France       | 0.022                                |
| Japan        | 0.001                                |

This uses the same model as in my [previous post]({% post_url 2019-09-21-rugby-world-cup}). 
I'm quite sure that I am underrating Japan by not allowing form to vary!
Otherwise, the results aren't wildly different to my predictions before the group stages.
